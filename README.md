# Biometrium
Python fingerprint recognition using SVM
## Instructions
Create directorys called Fingerprints_DB and Imposter_Fingerprints_DB in root directory and add fingerprint images. 
All images have to be as tif files and have the same dimensions, for best results use public datasets Neurotechnology CrossMatch and Neurotechnology UareU combined for Fingerprints_DB and for Imposter_Fingerprints_DB you can use FVC2000 DB2 B.

After that you can start program in terminal in root directory:
```
python .\Biometrium.py   
```
